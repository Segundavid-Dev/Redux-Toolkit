# React + TypeScript + Vite + RTK

This is a simple react CRUD app i used to learn the workflow of working with redux toolkit for handling global state management

## Tools

- Redux Toolkit: State Management
- Tailwind: Styling
- React: UI

## Features included

- Create new task
- Update task
- Delete Task
- Read Task
- Search filtering Option

All these states are been handled by RTK in my slice where i created a gloabal centralized store to manipulate mutating the state and dispatching actions that are available to all my app components
